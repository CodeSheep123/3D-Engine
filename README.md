# SaturnEngine

A complete rewrite of my old 3D renderer (SaturnEngine). SaturnEngine is a 3D game engine written in C++. 
Currently, I am working on this project alone.

# Coming Soon

Another rewrite with a new Vulkan renderer. (See the vulkan branch, https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/SaturnEngine/tree/vulkan)

# Features

- Creating and managing an application and window
- Rendering 3D meshes
- Entity Component System
- Flexible camera system based on the ECS
- Input system
- Asset Manager
- Scene Management
- Multiple viewports and cameras
- Serialization and deserializarion to and from JSON
- CPU Particle System
- Very rudimentary gravity system
- Basic AABB collision detection
- Editor (WIP)
- Sound System (based on my sound library [audeo](https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/audeo))

# Planned 

- Terrain Engine
- Physics Engine
- GPU Particle system
- Node based shader and material editor
